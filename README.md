## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

 Agile: Iterative, flexible, and collaborative.
  advantages:
. Flexibility to adapt to changes.
. Continuous feedback from stakeholders.
disadvantages:
. Can be chaotic without proper management.
. Requires active stakeholder involvement.

Waterfall: Sequential and structured.
advantages:
. Clear structure and documentation.
. Easier to manage for well-defined projects.
disadvantages:
. Inflexible to changes.
. Late discovery of issues.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is more beneficial in projects where requirements are expected to change e.g software development startups or mobile app projects and Waterfall is more beneficial in projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change e.g  construction projects 

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods for ensuring quality assurance:
. Code Reviews: Regular peer reviews to identify and solve issues early.
. Automated Testing: Use of automated tests to ensure code quality.
. Continuous Integration: Frequent integration and testing of code changes.

Importance of maintaining high standards is to ensure customer satisfaction

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Defining the project scope contributes to successful planning by providing clarity ensuring clear understanding of what is to be achieved, helps in prioritizing tasks and resources and prevents scope creep ensuring  the project stays on track.
Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work.it helps in organizing tasks, estimating costs, and assigning responsibilities.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of a detailed project schedule include:
. Timeline Management: Helps in tracking progress against deadlines.
. Resource Allocation: Ensures resources are used efficiently.
. Risk Mitigation: Identifies potential bottlenecks early.
Gantt charts  offers visualization and progress tracking which allows for easy tracking of task completion.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

Identifying pain points like inefficiency, security gaps helps develop targeted solutions.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

 defining the problem clearly guides feature development and avoids unnecessary features.
 
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

Focus on the value it delivers

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

Unique Functionalities and the user benefits

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

Size and growth potential
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?

helps to align your software with current market demands, guiding feature development and provides a competitive edge:
